# Maintainers[] Note - Immutable Returns for Determinism
To reduce flakiness from accidental mutations, ensure any function that returns a list or dict
converts it to an immutable structure immediately before returning.

- If returning a list, return `tuple(value)` instead of the list.
- If returning a dict, return `frozenset(value.items())` instead of the dict.

This rule must be followed. It improves reproducibility and protects callers from unintended side effects.
